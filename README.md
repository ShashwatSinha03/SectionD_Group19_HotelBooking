# Hotel Booking Cancellation & Revenue Optimization Analysis

## Project Overview

This project examines hotel booking behavior to identify structural drivers of cancellations and revenue instability within the hospitality sector.

Hotels often face financial uncertainty due to:
- Fluctuating demand  
- Seasonal variation  
- High cancellation rates  

These factors directly impact occupancy forecasting and revenue planning.

The analysis was conducted using **119,390 historical booking records** in Google Sheets.  
The project focuses on transforming raw booking data into structured, decision-oriented business insights.
